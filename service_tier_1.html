            <h3>Scope of Work (Slide 4, 17)</h3>
            <p>The Scope of Work defines how far we go during a service visit. It's in place so we are all on the same page and the customer receives consistent experience regardless of the technician.</p>
            <div class="key-point">
                <h4>Core Principles:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Follow established <strong>Protocols & Procedures</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Understand company <strong>Liability</strong> to avoid overstepping boundaries.</li>
                    <li><strong>When in Doubt:</strong> Always reach out to your Lead Tech or Supervisor. Going outside the scope breaks the standard of work we all follow.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>What is Best Effort? (Slide 8)</h3>
            <p>Best Effort means following the installation and troubleshooting steps with the equipment we are assisting with. This includes:</p>
            <ul class="info-list">
                <li>Google Fiber CPE</li>
                <li>Customer Owned Equipment (COE)</li>
                <li>Customer Education</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="panel"><div class="panel-content">
            <p>Effectively managing customer frustration is a critical first step. Remember, they are upset with the situation, not necessarily with you.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Listen without emotion:</strong> Give the customer your full attention and do not interrupt. When they are finished, let them know you were listening by calmly summarizing what they said.</li>
                <li><strong>Let the customer know you are listening:</strong> Use active listening and acknowledge their points.</li>
                <li><strong>Offer a Reply:</strong> Apologize, empathize, and maintain a calm and caring tone.</li>
                <li><strong>Take Responsibility:</strong> Take responsibility for the situation, even if you aren't at fault. DO NOT pass the buck, offer excuses, or blame a previous technician.</li>
                <li><strong>Resolve or Repair as Quickly as Possible:</strong> Be prepared with a plan of action and implement it soon.</li>
                <li><strong>Follow Up:</strong> Before leaving, tell the customer what problems you found, what you did to fix them, and any preventative measures taken.</li>

            <h4>Factors That Can Slow Your Network Speed</h4>
            <ul class="info-list">
                <li><strong>Out-of-date hardware:</strong> The type of hardware you use, age of the device, operating system, web browser, network interface card (NIC), available RAM, Hard Drive Space, and other applications running on your device all affect upload and download speeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Slow connections between Google Fiber's network and the websites you visit:</strong> Once your communication leaves the Fiber network, we can’t ensure you’ll receive maximum speeds due to heavy traffic or substantial rerouting delays at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>VPNs (Virtual Private Networks):</strong> If the VPN’s server isn’t capable of forwarding traffic at 1 gigabit, your Internet speed may be reduced to the speed the VPN server is capable of.</li>
                <li><strong>Latency:</strong> Latency is the measurement of how long it takes to transmit or receive packets on a particular network, and is affected by how far packets need to travel, how many network packets need to travel over, and the quality of those networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Packet loss:</strong> Like latency, packet loss can have a number of different causes, including network congestion, faulty hardware, poor device performance or the presence of software bugs.</li>

                <h4>Understanding the 6 GHz Band</h4>
                <p>The 6 GHz band is a new, expansive frequency (5.925 GHz to 7.125 GHz) made available for Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 devices. [2, 6] Its main advantage is that it is a "clean" band, free from interference from older, legacy Wi-Fi devices. [1, 2] This leads to more reliable, lower-latency connections, especially in dense environments. [3, 8] However, the shorter wavelength means it has the most difficulty passing through walls and solid objects, making it best for high-performance use in the same room as the router. [13]</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Channel Bonding & Interference (Slides 39-41)</h3>
            <p>Think of it like an information highway. A single lane (20 MHz) causes traffic congestion. Channel Bonding opens up more lanes (40, 80, 160 MHz), allowing more information to pass with less resistance.</p>
            <ul class="info-list">
                <li>802.11n allows up to <strong>40 MHz</strong> channel bonding.</li>
                <li>802.11ac allows up to <strong>80 MHz</strong> channel bonding.</li>
                <li>Wi-Fi 6/6E can use up to <strong>160 MHz</strong> channels. [14]</li>
                <li>Wi-Fi 7 doubles that to <strong>320 MHz</strong> channels in the 6 GHz band for massive throughput. [14, 17]</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The more overlapping networks you have, the greater the chance of network interference. Multi-Channel Bonded signals give your devices more options for a clear path to pass information.</p>

            <h3>Wi-Fi Encryption (WPA)</h3>
            <p>Wi-Fi encryption is a security protocol for wireless networks that encrypts the data being transmitted, preventing unauthorized access. Using the strongest available encryption is crucial for protecting user privacy and data.</p>
            <ul class="info-list">
                <li><strong>WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):</strong> An older protocol that replaced the original, insecure WEP standard. It is now considered outdated and vulnerable.</li>
                <li><strong>WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II):</strong> The long-time standard for security, using strong AES encryption. It is still widely used and secure for most purposes, but is being superseded by WPA3.</li>
                <li><strong>WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3):</strong> The current and most secure standard. It provides more robust authentication and increased cryptographic strength, making it much harder for attackers to crack passwords and eavesdrop on traffic, even on public networks.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="warning">
                <strong>Encryption's Impact on Wi-Fi Speed</strong>
                <p>It is critical to understand that the choice of encryption protocol directly impacts the maximum possible speed of a Wi-Fi network.</p>
                <ul class="info-list">
                    <li><strong>WPA (with TKIP):</strong> The original WPA protocol uses an encryption method called TKIP. The Wi-Fi standard (802.11n and newer) specifies that if TKIP is used, the network speed <strong>cannot exceed 54 Mbps</strong>. This is a hard-coded limitation to ensure network stability, as TKIP was not designed for the high throughput of modern Wi-Fi.</li>
                    <li><strong>WPA2 & WPA3 (with AES):</strong> To achieve speeds greater than 54 Mbps (such as the 144+ Mbps rates of Wi-Fi 4 and beyond), the network <strong>must</strong> be configured to use at least WPA2 with AES encryption. WPA3 also uses AES-based encryption and is required for the highest performance modes of Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Therefore, if a network is slow, checking for an outdated WPA/TKIP security setting can be a valid troubleshooting step, as it creates a significant performance bottleneck.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip"><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Always configure a customer's network to use the highest level of security supported by their router and devices, which is ideally WPA3. If WPA3 is not available, WPA2-AES is the minimum secure standard that should be used.</div>

             <div class="tip"><strong>Importance of Device Placement:</strong> The best place for a router is in a central, open location. A cabinet, behind a TV, or in the basement are not optimal locations for signal propagation.</div>

            <p>Network printer setup requires a careful balance between providing necessary connectivity support while staying within our service boundaries. Understanding what we do and don't support helps maintain consistent service delivery and clear customer expectations.</p>

            <p><strong>What we DO support:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Network printing ONLY.</strong> We can help connect a network-capable printer to the Wi-Fi.</li>
                <li>Maximum of <strong>one</strong> printer per household.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What we DO NOT support:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scanner, direct printing, or other setups.</li>
                <li>Driver or software installation.</li>
                <li>File sharing setups.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Printing (e.g., USB):</strong> We do not set up local printing.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="tip">Every printer is different. Use Google as a resource. Make sure the customer knows all information and settings may be reconfigured. <strong>Once you touch it, you own it.</strong></div>

        <button class="accordion">Routers (Bridging)</button>
        <div class="panel"><div class="panel-content">
            <p>Router bridging is a critical solution for extending network coverage while avoiding common networking issues like Double NAT. Understanding the bridging process and best practices ensures successful integration of customer-owned equipment.</p>

            <h4>Bridging Routers (Slides 71-72)</h4>
            <p>We can "bridge" routers to act as an access point and assist in setting up a mesh network. Most customers only need one router bridged. Bridging drops a router from a Layer 3 device (router) to a Layer 2 device (switch with Wi-Fi).</p>
            <div class="warning"><strong>Double NAT:</strong> Occurs when two routers are not bridged, preventing communication between devices on each network and blocking access to game servers, FTP, printers, etc.</div>
            
            <h4>How to Bridge a Router (General Steps - Slide 73):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Always get customer permission before doing this.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Factory Reset the Router:</strong> Clears custom settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Disable all internet</strong> on the bridging computer (including mobile data).</li>
                <li>Plug your computer into one of the router's <strong>LAN ports</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Login to the router</strong> (e.g., admin/admin, admin/password).</li>
                <li>Configure the Wi-Fi and <strong>Enable Bridge Mode</strong> (or AP Mode).</li>
                <li>Plug an internet source (NB or G-Wifi Point) into the router's <strong>LAN port</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Verify full functionality</strong> (Wi-Fi bands and Web Access/DNS).</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h4>Apple Airport Utility (Slide 74)</h4>
            <p>Apple routers are much easier to set up. Connect to the same network and the utility will find the devices.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On the Primary Base Station:</strong> go to Network Tab: Router Mode: Off (Bridge Mode)</li>
                <li><strong>On Time Capsule:</strong> go to Disk Tab: Enable File Sharing. Then run the Time Machine program on their MAC to verify it's functioning.</li>

            <p>Managing unsupported devices requires a clear understanding of service boundaries while still providing helpful guidance to customers. While we can't directly configure these devices, we can offer network validation and educational support to help customers resolve their connectivity issues.</p>

            <div class="key-point">For all unsupported devices, the general rule is: you can provide customer education, but you are <strong>not allowed to touch or configure</strong> the device. You should direct the customer to the <strong>KB port forwarding article</strong> for reference if applicable.</div>

                <li><strong>VoIP:</strong> We <strong>DO</strong> connect VoIP systems to the internet via Ethernet. We <strong>DO NOT</strong> connect phone lines/jacks or configure the device.</li>
                <li><strong>IoT & Home Automation:</strong> WE DO NOT SUPPORT THESE DEVICES. If the problem is connection-related, verify Wi-Fi is working from your laptop. If it's a firewall/NAT issue, educate and direct to the KB article.</li>
