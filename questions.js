      "Single-Mode Fiber is designed for long-distance communication using a single light path, Multi-Mode Fiber supports multiple light paths for shorter distances, and Plastic Optical Fiber is more flexible and cost-effective for short-range applications.",
      "Single-Mode Fiber uses multiple light paths leading to higher bandwidth, Multi-Mode Fiber uses a single light path for simplicity, and Plastic Optical Fiber is immune to electromagnetic interference.",
      "Single-Mode Fiber is made from plastic, Multi-Mode Fiber is made from glass, and Plastic Optical Fiber is exclusively used in automotive applications.",
      "Single-Mode Fiber is cheaper than Multi-Mode Fiber, Multi-Mode Fiber has higher bandwidth, and Plastic Optical Fiber cannot transmit data over long distances."
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Single-Mode Fiber utilizes a single light path (mode) which allows it to transmit data over longer distances with minimal signal loss and dispersion, making it ideal for telecommunications and long-haul networks. Multi-Mode Fiber supports multiple light paths, which can lead to higher modal dispersion, limiting its effective range to shorter distances such as within buildings or campuses. Plastic Optical Fiber is made from polymer materials, making it more flexible and less expensive, suitable for short-range applications like consumer electronics, automotive networks, and some local area networks (LANs). The other options present inaccuracies, such as incorrect materials, misconceptions about bandwidth and cost, or inappropriate application scenarios."

    question: "What is packet loss and what does it indicate?",
    type: "multiple_choice",
    options: [
      "Packet loss is the increase in packet size to enhance data transmission speed.",
      "Packet loss is the deliberate dropping of packets by firewalls to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "Packet loss refers to the delay in packet delivery due to high network traffic.",
      "Packet loss occurs when data packets fail to reach their destination, indicating potential network issues such as congestion, hardware failures, or poor signal quality."
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 3,
    explanation: "Packet loss happens when one or more data packets fail to reach their intended destination, which can be caused by network congestion, faulty hardware, poor signal quality, or other network issues. It can lead to reduced performance, dropped connections, and other communication problems. The other options describe different network concepts or incorrect interpretations of packet loss."

    question: "What is the difference between an Internal (Private) and an External (Public) IP address?",
    type: "multiple_choice",
    options: [
      "An Internal (Private) IP address can be accessed from outside the local network, whereas an External (Public) IP address is only accessible within the local network.",
      "An Internal (Private) IP address is used within a local network and is not routable on the internet, while an External (Public) IP address is assigned by an ISP and is used to identify devices on the internet.",
      "Internal (Private) IP addresses are always static, while External (Public) IP addresses are always dynamic.",
      "There is no difference; Internal and External IP addresses are interchangeable terms."
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Internal (Private) IP addresses are assigned to devices within a local network (e.g., home or office) and are not directly accessible from the internet. External (Public) IP addresses are assigned by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and are used to identify a network on the internet, allowing communication between devices across the internet. The other options are incorrect as private IPs are not accessible externally, they can be dynamic or static, and they are distinct concepts."

    question: "What are WiFi channels?",
    type: "multiple_choice",
    options: [
      "Specific frequency ranges within the WiFi spectrum used to transmit data between devices.",
      "Physical pathways that WiFi signals follow to reach their destinations.",
      "Security protocols used to encrypt WiFi communications.",
      "Hardware components in a WiFi router that manage signal distribution."
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 0,
    explanation: "WiFi channels are specific frequency ranges within the WiFi spectrum (such as the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands) that are used to transmit data between devices. Each channel operates at a different frequency to help reduce interference and manage bandwidth. Understanding and selecting the appropriate WiFi channel is crucial for optimizing network performance and minimizing interference from other wireless devices. The other options describe unrelated concepts: physical pathways, security protocols, and hardware components."

    question: "What does MSAP stand for, and why does clearing the MSAP help with provisioning issues?",
    type: "multiple_choice",
    options: [
      "Managed Service Access Point; clearing it updates firmware to resolve provisioning conflicts.",
      "Master Service Access Protocol; clearing it resets network configurations to default settings.",
      "Multi Signal Access Point; clearing it enhances signal strength for better provisioning.",
      "Multi Service Access Platform; clearing it removes stored device serial numbers in the ONT, allowing new devices to be attached and provisioned."
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 3,
    explanation: "MSAP stands for Multi Service Access Platform. The Optical Network Terminal (ONT) can handle only two devices simultaneously. The serial numbers of these devices are stored in the ONT’s cache. When provisioning a new device, the existing serial numbers may prevent additional devices from being connected. Performing an MSAP clear action removes these stored serial numbers from the ONT’s cache, thereby freeing up capacity and allowing new devices to be attached and provisioned successfully."

    question: "Which of the following are benefits of Mesh WiFi systems compared to 3rd-party extenders?",
    type: "check_all_that_apply",
    options: [
      "Dedicated backhaul for communication between extenders.",
      "Reduced bandwidth due to signal rebroadcasting.",
      "Centralized management via a mobile app.",
      "Consistent performance with adaptive routing."
    ],
    correctAnswerIndices: [0, 2, 3],
    explanation: "Mesh systems often use a dedicated backhaul (e.g., a separate radio band) to maintain speed between extenders, offer centralized management, and dynamically route traffic for optimal performance. Traditional extenders typically share bandwidth with connected devices, reducing overall speed."
